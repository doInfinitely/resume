                \item{Used my programming and mathematical skills to assist in the prototyping of neuroprosthetics.}

		    My \textbf{senior thesis} was the development of an Information Theoretic model of an Artificial Tactile Stimulation Task. The task itself was a discriminatory task in which rhesus macaques learned to distinguish digital objects based on their artificial texture which they sensed via direct brain stimulation when they interacted with the objects on a computer screen. My thesis analyzed their performance on these tasks to produce quantitative measures of the channel capacity of BMI systems.
